# recordstore — User Guide

`recordstore` is a versioned key→record store layered over any
content-addressed chunk store. This guide covers the concepts, the full
public API, the canonicity contract, running against a real Swarm/Bee node,
common versioning patterns, and current limitations.

Everything documented here is importable from the top-level package:

```python
from recordstore import (
    RecordStore,
    MemoryChunkStore, BeeChunkStore,
    MemoryPointer, FilePointer, SwarmFeedPointer,
    canonical_bytes,
)
```

## 1. Concepts

### Records

A **record** is any JSON-compatible value — `dict`, `list`, `str`, number,
bool, `None` — stored under a **non-empty string key**. Keys are plain
strings with no imposed structure; because iteration is sorted and
prefix-filtered, `/`-separated prefixes (`"users/alice"`) give you cheap
namespacing for free.

### Roots and versions

All records live in a persistent (copy-on-write) compacted radix trie whose
nodes are chunks in the chunk store. The trie's **root reference** — a hex
string — identifies one immutable, self-consistent snapshot of the *entire*
dataset. A root is to a dataset what a commit hash is to a git tree:

- hold a root ⇒ you can read that exact version forever (as long as the
  chunks exist),
- compare two roots with `==` ⇒ you know whether two datasets are identical,
- share a root ⇒ someone else can open the same version.

### Staging and commit

A `RecordStore` accumulates `put`/`delete` calls **in memory**. Nothing
touches the chunk store until `commit()`, which writes the changed records
and trie paths and returns the new root. Reads are
**read-your-writes**: staged changes shadow the committed state, so
`get`/`keys`/`contains` always reflect what you would see after committing.

Because versions share structure, a commit writes only the chunks along the
paths that changed; everything else is reused from the previous version.

### The canonicity guarantee

> **Equal content ⇒ equal root.** Two datasets containing the same
> key→value pairs have byte-identical roots, no matter what sequence of
> puts, deletes, and commits produced them.

This holds because every encoding in the stack is deterministic:

- **Values** are encoded with `canonical_bytes` — JSON with sorted object
  keys, minimal separators, UTF-8, `NaN`/`Infinity` rejected (they have no
  canonical JSON form). Two structurally equal values always produce the
  same bytes, hence the same chunk reference.
- **Trie nodes** are canonically encoded, and the trie maintains two
  structural invariants so its *shape* is a pure function of its contents:
  a node with no value and no children does not exist, and a node with no
  value and exactly one child is merged into that child.

Consequences you can rely on:

- deduplication — identical values are stored once;
- O(1) version comparison — `root_a == root_b`;
- history independence — replaying operations in any order that reaches the
  same final content reaches the same root (this is the substrate for
  building CRDT-style merges above this layer);
- idempotent commits — committing with nothing staged (or with staged
  writes equal to what's already stored) returns the same root.

One subtlety: JSON does not distinguish `1` from `1.0`, and Python types
that JSON normalizes (tuples become lists) come back in their JSON form.
Store what JSON can represent faithfully.

`canonical_bytes(value)` is exported for anything that needs byte-identical
encodings of its own (hashing application-level objects, testing).

## 2. `RecordStore` API

### Constructing

```python
RecordStore(chunks, root=None, pointer=None)
```

- `chunks` — any object satisfying the `ChunkStore` protocol (§3).
- `root` — open at an existing version. `None` starts from the empty
  dataset (or from the pointer's value, see next).
- `pointer` — any object satisfying the `Pointer` protocol (§4). If given
  and `root` is `None`, the store opens at `pointer.get()`; every
  successful `commit()` then advances the pointer to the new root.

```python
RecordStore.at(root, chunks)   # classmethod
```

Opens a **read-only snapshot** at `root`. Reads work as usual;
`put`/`delete`/`commit` raise `TypeError`. Use this whenever you want to
read a version without any risk of writing.

```python
store.root   # property
```

The root of the last committed state (staged changes are *not* included —
it changes only on `commit()`). `None` for a brand-new empty store.

### Reading

```python
store.get(key)         # → value (deep copy); raises KeyError if absent
store.contains(key)    # → bool
store.keys(prefix="")  # → iterator of keys, sorted, staged overlay included
```

- Returned values are **deep copies** — mutating them never mutates the
  store. Write changes back with `put`.
- `keys("users/")` iterates only keys starting with that prefix, in sorted
  order. The prefix is a plain string prefix, not a path component — 
  `keys("users")` also matches `"users2/x"`.

### Writing

```python
store.put(key, value)  # stage an insert/overwrite
store.delete(key)      # stage a removal; raises KeyError if absent
```

- `put` validates immediately: the key must be a non-empty string
  (`ValueError` otherwise) and the value must be canonically encodable
  (`TypeError`/`ValueError` from the JSON encoder otherwise — this fails
  fast at `put` time, never at `commit` time).
- `put` stores a detached copy of the value: mutating your object after
  `put` does not change what was staged.
- Staged changes are read-your-writes and can overwrite each other freely;
  only the final staged state matters at commit.

### Committing

```python
root = store.commit()  # → new root reference (hex string), or None if the
                       #   dataset is empty
```

Flushes staged changes in deterministic (sorted-key) order, updates
`store.root`, advances the pointer if one is attached, and returns the new
root. The pointer moves only after every chunk write has succeeded, so a
reader following the pointer sees all of a commit or none of it.

Deleting a key that was staged-but-never-committed simply drops it;
committing a delete of a key that never existed in the trie is a no-op.

### Error summary

| Situation | Raised |
|---|---|
| `get`/`delete` of a missing key | `KeyError` |
| empty or non-string key | `ValueError` |
| non-JSON-encodable value in `put` | `TypeError` / `ValueError` |
| `NaN` / `Infinity` in a value | `ValueError` |
| write on a read-only snapshot | `TypeError` |
| chunk missing from the chunk store | `KeyError` (from the backend) |

## 3. Chunk store backends

The `ChunkStore` protocol is two methods:

```python
class ChunkStore(Protocol):
    def put(self, data: bytes) -> str: ...   # → reference
    def get(self, ref: str) -> bytes: ...    # KeyError if missing
```

Any content-addressed store satisfying it works — the reference just has to
be a stable hex string determined by the content.

### `MemoryChunkStore()`

A dict keyed by SHA-256. Use it for tests and ephemeral work; `len(store)`
gives the chunk count. Data lives only as long as the object.

### `BeeChunkStore(api_url, postage_batch_id, deferred_upload=True)`

A real [Swarm Bee](https://docs.ethswarm.org/) node over its HTTP API
(`POST`/`GET /bytes`). References are Swarm BMT references. Requirements
and behavior:

- **`requests`** is imported lazily inside the constructor — install the
  `[bee]` extra.
- **A usable postage batch id is required for writes.** Against a real
  (mainnet) node, always purchase a batch yourself and pass its id;
  batches below ~1 day of validity are rejected by the network, and a
  fresh purchase takes on the order of a minute to become usable.
- `deferred_upload=True` (default) returns as soon as the node has the
  data locally, with push-sync to the network happening in the background;
  `False` waits. Check network retrievability with Bee's
  `GET /stewardship/{ref}` if you need the guarantee.
- Values larger than one 4 KB chunk are handled transparently by Bee's
  splitter — any payload yields exactly one reference.
- HTTP timeouts are 120 s; a 404 surfaces as `KeyError`, other HTTP errors
  as `requests.HTTPError`.

A quick smoke against a local node:

```python
from recordstore import RecordStore, BeeChunkStore

chunks = BeeChunkStore("http://localhost:1633", "<batch-id>")
store = RecordStore(chunks)
store.put("hello", {"world": True})
root = store.commit()
print(RecordStore.at(root, chunks).get("hello"))
```

Because chunks are immutable and content-addressed, mixing backends is
safe in one direction: anything written through one `BeeChunkStore` is
readable through any other Bee node that can retrieve the chunks.

## 4. Pointers

A root reference identifies a version forever, but something has to name
“the latest version.” That is a `Pointer`:

```python
class Pointer(Protocol):
    def get(self) -> Optional[str]: ...
    def set(self, root: str) -> None: ...
```

Attach one at construction and it is read at open and advanced on every
commit:

```python
from recordstore import RecordStore, MemoryChunkStore, FilePointer

pointer = FilePointer("/var/lib/myapp/ROOT")
store = RecordStore(chunks, pointer=pointer)   # opens at the pointed root
store.put("k", 1)
store.commit()                                  # pointer now names the new root
```

- **`MemoryPointer(root=None)`** — in-process only.
- **`FilePointer(path)`** — one root in a local file; `set` writes a temp
  file and `os.replace`s it, which is atomic on POSIX, so a crash never
  leaves a torn pointer. A missing file reads as `None`.
- **`SwarmFeedPointer`** — a documented stub that raises
  `NotImplementedError`. A Swarm feed update is a signed single-owner
  chunk: it must be BMT-hashed and secp256k1-signed client-side, which
  needs an Ethereum signing dependency and is deliberately out of scope
  for the stdlib-only core. The `Pointer` interface is the contract;
  swapping the real implementation in changes nothing above it.

---

## 5. Versioning patterns

**Time travel.** Keep the roots your application cares about (commit ids,
checkpoints); open any of them later:

```python
v1 = store.commit()
store.put("config", {"mode": "fast"})
v2 = store.commit()

old = RecordStore.at(v1, chunks)   # v1 is untouched by later commits
```

**Long consistent reads.** Snapshots are immutable, so a reporting job can
iterate `keys()` and `get()` for hours against one root while writers
commit new versions concurrently — no locks, no torn reads.

**Cheap change detection.** Two stores (or two moments of one store) are
equal iff their roots are equal. To sync, compare roots first and walk keys
only on mismatch.

**Branching.** Open two stores at the same root, let them diverge, and
commit each — you get two versions sharing most of their structure. There
is no built-in merge (see §7); equal-content branches converge to the same
root by canonicity.

**Idempotent writers.** A writer that recomputes and re-puts the same
records produces the same root — safe to re-run, and downstream consumers
comparing roots see “no change.”

---

## 6. Performance notes

- **One record = one value chunk**, plus one chunk per trie node along the
  key's path. Trie nodes are compacted (radix), so path length tracks key
  *distinctiveness*, not key length.
- **Commits write O(changed paths) chunks**, not O(dataset).
- **Trie nodes are cached in memory** after first load (they are immutable,
  so the cache never invalidates). Re-reading the same region of a store or
  snapshot is cheap; a cold open pays one chunk fetch per trie level per
  distinct path.
- Reads through `BeeChunkStore` are one HTTP roundtrip per (uncached) chunk.
  There is no batched fetch yet; if you need to hydrate an entire dataset,
  iterate `keys()` then `get()` — every record is fetched exactly once.

---

## 7. Limitations and roadmap

- **Single writer.** There is no concurrency control: two `RecordStore`
  instances committing over the same pointer will last-write-win at the
  pointer level, silently discarding the loser's commit from the "latest"
  chain (both roots remain readable). Multi-writer merge is an
  application-layer concern for now; the canonical-root property is the
  designed foundation for building one.
- **`SwarmFeedPointer` is a stub** pending a client-side SOC-signing
  dependency decision (see §4).
- **No garbage collection.** Old versions' chunks are never deleted by this
  library. On Swarm, chunk lifetime is governed by postage stamps and the
  network's GC — content simply expires unless re-stamped or pinned; for
  `MemoryChunkStore` everything lives until the process exits.
- **Record schema version.** Every value chunk is wrapped in
  `{"rsv": 1, "val": ...}`; a future format bump will change `rsv` and
  readers reject unknown versions rather than misread them. Trie nodes
  carry an analogous `"tn": 1`.
- **Key iteration materializes matches.** `keys(prefix)` collects matching
  keys before yielding (sorted output); very large result sets cost
  proportional memory.

## 8. Testing your own usage

The test suite doubles as executable documentation:

- `tests/test_recordstore.py` — the API contract: canonical roots, snapshot
  isolation, structural sharing, no aliasing, pointer atomicity.
- `tests/test_recordstore_fuzz.py` — randomized put/delete histories against
  a dict oracle, asserting the canonical-root property throughout.
- `tests/test_recordstore_bee.py` — the same store over a live Bee node
  (`BEE_API`/`BEE_BATCH` env vars; skips otherwise).
- `tests/test_boundaries.py` — enforces that module-level imports stay
  stdlib-only.

When building on the `ChunkStore` or `Pointer` protocols, the
`MemoryChunkStore`/`MemoryPointer` pairing plus the fuzz test's
oracle pattern is a good template for validating an implementation.
